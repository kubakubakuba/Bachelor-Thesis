This thesis presents a way to estimate the relative position of an object equipped with modulated light emitters
using an event-based camera as our sensor. Our approach beings by detecting and clustering the asynchronous "blobs" of
event pixels; for which we compute their centroids. By associating these centroids with the known geometry of the light
emitters, we solve the rotation and translation of the object via the Perspective-n-Point algorithm.
To ensure accurate measurements, we first perform a customized camera and lens calibration procedure, which
consists of target with equally spaced diodes, to provide bright reference points during calibration.
Finally, we validate our approach on both static and actively moving quadrotor platforms, whose results show
