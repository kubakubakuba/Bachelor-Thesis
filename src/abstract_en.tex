\section*{Abstract}
\vskip 0.5em
This thesis presents a way to estimate the relative pose of an object equipped with modulated light emitters
using an event-based camera as the sensor. Our approach begins by detecting and clustering the asynchronous "blobs" of
event pixels; for which their centroids are computed. By associating these centroids with the known geometry of the light
emitters, the rotation and translation of the object is solved for via the Perspective-n-Point algorithm.
To ensure accurate measurements, a customized camera and lens calibration procedure is first performed, which
consists of target with equally spaced diodes, to provide bright reference points during calibration.
Experimental validation on static and dynamically moving quadrotors demonstrates an average localization accuracy of tens of
centimeters in stationary scenarios and a meters-level precision at large distances during active motion.
