\section*{Abstract}
\vskip 0.5em
This thesis presents a way to estimate the relative pose of an object equipped with modulated light emitters
using an event-based camera as the sensor. Our approach begins by detecting and clustering the asynchronous "blobs" of
event pixels; for which we compute their centroids. By associating these centroids with the known geometry of the light
emitters, we solve the rotation and translation of the object via the Perspective-n-Point algorithm.
To ensure accurate measurements, we first perform a customized camera and lens calibration procedure, which
consists of target with equally spaced diodes, to provide bright reference points during calibration.
Experimental validation on static and dynamically moving quadrotors demonstrates an average localization accuracy of tens of
centimeters in stationary scenarios and a meters-level precision at large distances during active motion.
