This thesis presents a way of estimating a position of a object equipped with sources of modulated light
by an event-based camera. This is done by detecting the centers of the detected blobs of pixels, made by the modulated
light, and using them to estimate the rotation and translation of the physical model.
We also discuss the camera calibration, which is needed to be performed in order to obtain correct data for the subsequent analysis, which is performed on a static and flying drones.
