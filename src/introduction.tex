\chapter{Introduction\label{chap:introduction}}

The rapid advancement of \ac{UAV} swarms has intensified the demand for robust and scalable relative pose estimation methods.
Traditional solutions relying on \ac{GNSS} suffer from limitations in indoor environments, signal occlusion, and interference that arises from
multi-agent communication.
\ac{VLP} systems, which leverage modulated \ac{LED} signals and optical sensors, offer a promising alternative due to their immunity to radio
frequency interference and high precision.

However, conventional frame-based cameras used in \ac{VLP} systems struggle with motion blur, latency,
and dynamic range constraints. For example, under bright illumination, \ac{LED}s may not produce a sufficiently detectable signal,
which may lead to localization failure. In contrast, event-based cameras overcome these limitations by asynchronously detecting pixel-level
brightness changes, providing microsecond temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and minimal latency. These attributes make them ideal for
capturing high-frequency LED signals, even in challenging lighting conditions or during aggressive \ac{UAV} maneuvers in agile swarming applications.

In this thesis, we present a method for estimating the pose of a \ac{UAV} equipped with \ac{UV} \ac{LED} light sources as in the UVDAR system. \cite{walteruvdar}
These \ac{LED}s are modulated at select frequencies, which aids in their identification and also helps with their prevalence
on the scene observed by the camera. After the camera is properly calibrated and the LED source locations are identified, a Perspective-n-Point 
algorithm is used to estimate the location of the \ac{UAV} in the 3D space. This estimation is then compared with the ground truth positions obtained
from the \ac{GNSS}.
