\chapter{Experiment\label{chap:experiment}}

The experiment was performed with two X500 \ac{UAV}s, each of them equipped with a Prophesee EVK4 event-based camera, one with a 2.5mm f/1.6
fish eye lens with an \ac{FOV} of 93.5 degrees and the second one with Entaniya 1.07mm f/2.8 fish eye lens with an \ac{FOV} of 280 degrees.
Each UAV is also equipped with a Basler camera with a fish eye lens, to provide normal video signal that is recorded alongside the event stream
from the event-based camera.
Both cameras are connected to the onboard Intel NUC computer running the ROS system, on which all the processing is done during the flight. Both 
\ac{UAV}s are also equipped with a \ac{RTK} module, which is used to localize the \ac{UAV}, and is used as ground truth data for the pose estimation.
The UVDAR blinking frequencies $\mathcal{F} = \{4.0, 2.0, 1.\overline{3}, 1.0\}$ (in kHz) were defined, where each of the arms were blinking at its assigned
frequency.
The measurements were collected during the \ac{MRS} Camp in Temešvár in August 2025, the \ac{UAV}s can be seen on \reffig{fig:uav33_37}.

Two pilots manually controlled the \ac{UAV}s, systematically varying the distance and angles between them to generate diverse measurement data during the experiment. All in-flight data, including sensor measurements and camera streams, we recorden in a \ac{ROS} bag file for subsequent analysis
in a simulated environment. In addition, raw event stream data from the event-based camera was also recorded and saved. The camera view from the UAV33
can be seen on \reffig{fig:exp1}
