abstract = {In this paper an improved method for calibrating wide-angle, fisheye and omnidirectional imaging systems is presented. We extend the calibration procedure proposed by Scaramuzza et al. by replacing the residual function and joint refinement of all parameters. In doing so, we achieve a more stable, robust and accurate calibration (up to factor 7) and can reduce the number of necessary calibration steps from five to three. After introducing the camera model and highlighting the differences from the current calibration procedure, we perform a comprehensive performance evaluation using several data sets and show the impact of the proposed calibration procedure on the calibration results.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel dense SLAM system based on depth-event fusion, aiming to address the challenge of online dense reconstruction in challenging environments. To achieve robust camera tracking, we devise a hybrid depth-event pose estimation framework based on random optimization, which estimates all states jointly. Notably, we introduce an innovative 3D-2D edge alignment method based on particle swarm optimization, specifically tailored for event cameras, to tackle the highly non-linear pose estimation problem. Furthermore, we implement a dynamic update mechanism for both geometric and intensity edges of the 3D reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate management of edge information. Our method represents the first depth-event dense SLAM system employing a random optimization paradigm, achieving robust performance even with high-speed camera motion, specifically linear velocities exceeding 1 m/s and/or angular velocities exceeding 2 rad/s. The system achieves accurate and globally consistent dense mapping with a maximum spatial resolution of 2 mm, while maintaining real-time performance at approximately 30 FPS for simultaneous localization and 3D reconstruction. Through extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly on our newly constructed DEveSet dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art techniques such as InfiniTAM, ROSEFusion, and DEVO.
